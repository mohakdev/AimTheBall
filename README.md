*Aim the ball is a mobile game for android. Your main objective in this game is to make sure that the ball goes in the hole. There are multiple levels in the game and each level is harder than the previous one.* **The game is quite small because i am still new to Unity(The game engine used to make the game).** Also the game is **OPEN-SOURCED** which means that anyone who knows how to make games in Unity Game Engine can download its source code and make their own version of the game.
